/**
 * RFCOMM connector for Android.
 * This class allows you to communicate with a Bluetooth device via RFCOMM protocol (SPP profile).
 * It calls the Java API of the Android OS, since there is no native API for bluetooth available.
 * <p>
 * This class does not provide a feature to pair devices. The user may do that manually in the
 * system settings of the Android device. Once a device is paired, you can communicate with it.
 * <p>
 * Please note that Qt 5.3 supports bluetooth on Android out of the box.
 * This class may be used as an alternative, specially on Qt 5.0 ... 5.2.
 * It will possibly also work in future versions.
 * <p>
 * Your project file must contain
 * QT += core androidextras
 * <p>
 * Your android.xml file must contain
 * <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
